# polyweb-js
Welcome to Polyweb! This is an interactive polymerisation simulator with JavaScript, where three chemical species (initiator, monomer, and RAFT agent) react in a container and gradually produce different radicals and products. More precisely, the polymerisation process involved is Reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. The user can specify the initial concentrations of the monomer and RAFT agent, as well as the maximum simulation time. The simulation model itself is very simple and makes a lot of assumptions/simplifications.
